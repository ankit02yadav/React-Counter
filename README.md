# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


# React Counter Application

This is a simple React counter application built using React hooks. It allows the user to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value.

## Features
- **Increment**: Increase the counter value by 1.
- **Decrement**: Decrease the counter value by 1.
- **Reset**: Reset the counter value back to 0.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **useState**: React hook used for creating a stateful variable and its setter function to manage the counter's value.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-counter.git
Navigate to the project directory:

    cd react-counter
Install the necessary dependencies:

    npm install
Start the development server:

    npm start
This will run the app at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## How it works
The counter's value is stored in a state variable using the useState hook. The value is updated using the setter function returned by useState.

Increment: The counter is increased by 1 when the "Increment" button is clicked.
Decrement: The counter is decreased by 1 when the "Decrement" button is clicked.
Reset: The counter is reset to 0 when the "Reset" button is clicked.
Project Structure

    /src
    /components
     Counter.js       # Main counter component
    /styles
    counter.css      # Styles for the counter application
    App.js             # Main app component
    index.js           # Entry point to render the app
## CSS Styling
The project includes basic CSS styling in counter.css to handle the layout of the buttons and the counter value.

## Future Improvements
Add unit tests for the components.
Enhance styling with animations and transitions.
Implement local storage to persist counter state across page refreshes.
